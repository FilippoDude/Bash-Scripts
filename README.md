This is one of my first bash scripts that i actually publish on github.

Right now this section only includes the dockerStarter script wich is a script for linux Docker.

This is a script that is meant to be used for starting up Dockers quickly.

It can:
    - Restart stopped dockers;
    - Start a docker using an image with the same name;
    - Quickly allow a person to interact with the needed docker;
    - List active and inactive containers;
    - List all images;

The script includes a quick mode and a guided mode.

Feel free to use it just please credit me :)
